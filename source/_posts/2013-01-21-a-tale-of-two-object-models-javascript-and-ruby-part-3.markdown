This is part 3 of my series of posts that explore the Javascript and Ruby object models. The goal of this series is to introduce the fundamental concepts
of both languages by demonstrating their similarities and differences. If you haven't already, I recommend you check out parts one and two
which attempt to describe what objects are and how they are created. This post will focus on more of the interesting aspect how (Javascript) properties
or (Ruby) methods are resolved or *looked up*. By taking a look at this, we get a good idea of how inheritance works in both languages.
